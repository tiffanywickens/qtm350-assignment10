    "This assignment is about parallel computing with Dask. You should use Python to implement the calculations. If possible, please submit your answers in PDF  or HTML format. In case you have any issues installing Dask via pip, please use the following command:\n",
    "\n",

    "Your answer here: Overhead in parallel computing refers to the additional time and resources required to manage and coordinate multiple processes or threads. This includes the time taken to start up worker processes, distribute tasks, communicate between processes, and gather results. \n",
    "\n",
    "When running a very simple task, such as adding 1 to a number, the actual computation time is extremely short. However, the overhead associated with setting up parallel execution can be significant compared to the time taken for the computation itself. As a result, the total time taken for the parallel execution (including overhead) can exceed the time taken for serial execution, making it slower overall"

    "Your answer here: The difference between `dask.dataframe.compute()` and `dask.dataframe.persist()` lies in how they handle the computation of Dask DataFrames. `dask.dataframe.compute()` triggers the execution of the entire computation graph and returns the result as a concrete Pandas DataFrame. It is typically used when you want to obtain the final result of your computations and are ready to bring the data into memory. On the other hand, `dask.dataframe.persist()` triggers the computation but keeps the result as a Dask DataFrame, storing it in distributed memory. This allows for faster subsequent computations on the persisted data without recomputing from scratch. You would typically use `.persist()` when you have a large dataset that you want to keep in memory for multiple operations, as it can significantly speed up subsequent computations by avoiding redundant calculations."
